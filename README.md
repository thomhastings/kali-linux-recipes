kali-linux-recipes
==================

This repository will host various "Kali Linux Recipes", or live-build configurations which can generate various images of Kali Linux.
Hopefully, these scripts will be useful even if they are just used for reference. Fast internet required as well as ample space to 
build and generate an ISO file....good luck with your Kali cooking. Do you have an interesting recipe ? Send it over to info at kali dot org!
